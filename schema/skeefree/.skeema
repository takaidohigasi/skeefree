# Skeefree eats its own dog food, and has `.skeema` settings and `skeefree` directives.
# The prefix `skeema:` is ignored (any prefix with colon is ignored). It is used to make it explicit that the schema is never an actual production schema.
# The suffix, `skeefree_production` is the actual name of the schema in production.
